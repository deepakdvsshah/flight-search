View by DATE (default when oneWay is true) to get the cheapest flight destination for every departure date in the given range. View by DURATION (default when oneWay is false) to get the cheapest flight destination for every departure date and for every duration in the given ranges. View by WEEK to get the cheapest flight destination for every week in the given range of departure dates. View by COUNTRY to get the cheapest flight destination by country. Note that specifying a detailed view but large ranges may result in a huge number of flight destinations being returned.

set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.\nQuick Start & Documentation\nNx Documentation\n10-minute video showing all Nx features\nInteractive Tutorial\nAdding capabilities to your workspace\nNx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.\nThese capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.\nBelow are our core plugins:\n\nAngular\nng add @nrwl/angular\n\n\nReact\nng add @nrwl/react\n\n\nWeb (no framework frontends)\nng add @nrwl/web\n\n\nNest\nng add @nrwl/nest\n\n\nExpress\nng add @nrwl/express\n\n\nNode\nng add @nrwl/node\n\n\n\nThere are also many community plugins you could add.\nGenerate an application\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app to generate an application.\n\nYou can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.\n\nWhen using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.\nGenerate a library\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib to generate a library.\n\nYou can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.\n\nLibraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @flight-search/mylib.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve my-app for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng g component my-component --project=my-app to generate a new component.\nBuild\nRun ng build my-app to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test my-app to execute the unit tests via Jest.\nRun nx affected:test to execute the unit tests affected by a change.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e my-app to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.\nRun nx affected:e2e to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.\nUnderstand your workspace\nRun nx dep-graph to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.\nFurther help\nVisit the Nx Documentation to learn more.\n☁ Nx Cloud\nComputation Memoization in the Cloud\n\n\nNx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.\nTeams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nx’s advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.\nVisit Nx Cloud to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
